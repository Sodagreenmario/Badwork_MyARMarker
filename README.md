# MyARMarker
### The Confession
This work was finished when at the beginning of my sophomore life. My tutor suggeseted me to do some work on AR marker even if I didn't know it. I think it's a bad work. Little preparation, weak coding ability, all these factors made me fail. However, I decided to share my last version of it, reminding me be responsible for myself.
### The Main Idea
Draw a circle on a paper, then regard this circle as a AR marker. Firstly, we draw a retangle on the circle. Then, using Fitzgibbonâ€™s ellipse fitting method get some possible eclipse center points to feed a cluster method called Affinity Propagation. A initial AR object was created on it. Then KCF object tracking method will track the circle, and calculate the relative bias of the eclipse. The new AR object will be drawn on the canvas.
